      window.onload = function() {
        canvas = document.getElementById('gameCanvas')//one of the sole reasons that we do this is because we can now access the height and width properties of the canvas, because all along i couldve done, document.getElementById('gameCanvas').getContext('2d'), you know
        canvasContext = canvas.getContext('2d')  //we have both of our references...
        canvasContext.fillStyle = 'black'; //can also be a hex value.
        canvasContext.fillRect(0,0, canvas.width, canvas.height); // so this is interesting, right here we are setting the fill style of the rectangle we are about to make, and this rectangle is simply going to be starting at the top left corner and its going to have the height and the width of the canvas, meaning we now have a black background.
