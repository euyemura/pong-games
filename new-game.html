                      //canvasContext.fillRect(375, 260, 50, 80) // this would actually be the very center of the rectangle.also any shape that is drawn after another shape will be the one that covers the other shape, pretty cool right.

      canvasContext.arc(100, 100, 10, 0, Math.PI*2, true); // basically, thr 100, 100 is where the very center of the ball will be, then, the 10 is what the radius of the ball is, meaning its diameter would be 20, then, from the 0 angle, meaning the x line on the right side, imma draw pi amount in the clockwise direction.
      canvasContext.fill();  //this beginPath and fill are things that you just simply do to speciy
